# Swiss Voting Advice Verifier

This is a code verifier for Swiss voting advice applications (currently only smartvote is working though, as I haven't figured out a way to test easyvote & vimentis).
It has been programmed in polymer. -> https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/install-3-0

 
## Results

Smartvote -> algorithm appears to work with Ständeräte/Nationalräte (json with answers)

## TODO

**if needed**:
*smartvote*
-> nr-lists?

-> do the same for *easyvote* and *vimentis* -> how though...
